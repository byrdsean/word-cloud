# Python Word-Cloud Algorithm

* Program written in Python to read in a text file, and builds a word-cloud using HTML and CSS.

* The stop words is a list from https://countwordsfree.com/stopwords. This program will only consider words <= 3 characters.

* The package.json file uses the "assests" object to read in inputs.

## Issues for the future:

* Provide better error handling.

* Allow command-line arguments.

* Handle unicode characters.
